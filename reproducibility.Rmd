# Overview 

The Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto are excited to host a two-day conference bringing together academic and industry participants on the critical issue of reproducibility in applied statistics (very broadly defined). The conference will be hosted online on Thursday and Friday 25-26 February 2021. Everyone is welcome, you don't need to be affiliated with a university, and you can register [here](https://forms.gle/txLw43Q7UsXjzQys8).

The conference has three broad areas of focus:

- **Evaluating reproducibility:** Have you tried to systematically look at the extent of reproducibility of a paper or even in a whole field? Does, say, economics fall flat while demography shines? How did you go about your study? What aspects contributed to your findings?
- **Practices of reproducibility:** Have you developed some tools and approaches that make reproducibility easier? 
- **Teaching reproducibility:** How can we ensure that today's undergraduate and graduate students don't repeat the mistakes of earlier generations? What are some case studies that show promise?

Free and online via Zoom. We intend to record the presentations and will add links here ex post.

Everyone is welcome. You don't need to be affiliated with a university.

If you would like to attend, then please sign up [here](https://forms.gle/txLw43Q7UsXjzQys8).

His other projects also help understand the mechanics of representation, including: public opinion and Congress, modern survey statistics and causal inference, and election administration. Prior to and during graduate school, he worked at the Analyst Institute in Washington D.C.
- [Tiffany Timbers](https://www.tiffanytimbers.com/) is an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Statistics and an Co-Director for the Master of Data Science program (Vancouver Option) at the University of British Columbia.
