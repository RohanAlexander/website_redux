# Call for abstracts

If you would like to present a paper then please register and submit an abstract [here](https://forms.gle/txLw43Q7UsXjzQys8). Abstracts are due 15 December 2020. Notification of acceptance will occur a week or two after that. 

Folks who have traditionally been under-represented in statistics are especially encouraged to apply.

We welcome anything to do with reproducibility, but the conference has four broad areas of focus:

- **Applications of reproducibility:** Do you have an example and/or case studies of especially reproducible work? What are these gold standards, what makes them great, and how can we all achieve this standard?
- **Evaluating reproducibility:** Have you tried to systematically look at the extent of reproducibility in a field? Does, say, economics fall flat while demography shines? How did you go about your study? What aspects contributed to your findings?
- **Practices of reproducibility:** Have you developed some tools and approaches that make reproducibility easier? 
- **Teaching reproducibility:** How can we ensure that today's undergraduate and graduate students don't repeat the mistakes of earlier generations? What are some case studies that show promise?
