# Overview

Since Fall 2019, the Toronto Data Workshop (TDW) has brought together researchers from various academic disciplines as well as industry to collectively consider, collate, share, and disseminate best practices in the critical initial data-centric steps of any data science project: collection; cleaning; storage; retrieval; dissemination; and protection. We meet weekly for an hour and aim to have a roughly even split of participants from academia and industry over the course of each term. 

We meet on Thursdays at 4-5pm (Toronto time) via Zoom. For an invitation please sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8). Anyone is welcome to attend - you don't need to be affiliated with the university. 
We start at 4:01 with a brief welcome and then three minutes of break-out rooms to meet some of the other participants. At 4:05 we return to the main room and the speaker is introduced. Speakers typically speak for 20-45 minutes, during which participants are encouraged to add comments and questions to the chat, rather than verbally interrupting. We then have a chaired question period, in which those with questions are asked to signal this in the chat, at which point they'll be called on to introduce themselves and ask their question.

The current organising committee is: Faria Khandaker, [Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/), and Rohan Alexander. The TDW is a joint initiative between the Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto and we especially thank Dean Wendy Duff and Chair Radu Craiu for their support.
