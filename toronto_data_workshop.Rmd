# Overview

The Toronto Data Workshop (TDW) brings together academia and industry to consider, collate, share, and disseminate best practices in the initial data-centric steps of a data science project: collection; cleaning; storage; retrieval; dissemination; and protection. We meet weekly for an hour and aim to have a roughly even split of participants from academia and industry over the course of each term. For an invitation please sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8). Anyone is welcome to attend - you don't need to be affiliated with the university. 

The current organising committee is: Faria Khandaker, [Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/), and Rohan Alexander. The TDW is a joint initiative between the Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto and we especially thank Dean Wendy Duff and Chair Radu Craiu for their support.

	[Shiro](https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/) is a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Government, Harvard University. His research focuses on democratic representation in American Politics, for instance cast vote records, public opinion, survey methods, and applied statistics more generally. Shiro will bring together best practices for organizing data and code in the social sciences that experts have proposed with some of his own experience. He will propose a project-oriented workflow that adopts a minimal and consistent file organization structure within a single project, using RStudio Projects and GitHub. He will then discuss how to organize multiple projects that share common components, and propose the use of custom R packages to share code and Dataverse to share large datasets. He will use some of his own projects involving the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), one of the largest political surveys of American Politics, as a demonstration.
