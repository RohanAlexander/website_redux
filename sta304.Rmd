# Content

## Week 1

*10 September 2020, Establishing a foundation*

This week I'll upload a few videos before-hand, to save us some time, but we'll also meet on Thursday morning to discuss a few aspects, meet the TAs, answer any of your questions, and run through some examples. A recording of that will be uploaded. I will run the lab (11am-noon), which will just focus on dealing with any installation issues. As that's more specific to individuals I won't record that.

The core of the course is in the notes that I will provide links to. You should go through these in detail. Run the examples. Try to change them slightly and see what happens. Do the readings that you are interested in. Read the help docs for the functions. This is the core of your learning. Lectures mostly just exist for you to have a chance to discuss your thoughts with me.

Read & write - that is the life that you have signed up for. When it comes to this course, if you are not reading or writing, then you are almost surely wasting your time.

This week is about ensuring that you have an appropriate foundation on which we can build the rest of the course. You should already have covered much of this week’s content in previous courses - this week ensures that everyone has covered the basics. If you have gaps in your knowledge, then please address them.
