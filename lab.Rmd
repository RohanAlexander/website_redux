The Toronto Data Lab exists to:

1. conduct research at the intersection of information and statistical sciences; 
2. bring together researchers and practitioners from various academic disciplines and industry; and
3. provide high-quality training opportunities for students.

The lab organises the Toronto Data Workshop, which everyone is welcome to attend - sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8). We also maintain an internal reading group and presentation schedule.

## Director/PI

- Rohan Alexander

## Faculty affiliates

- Professor Kelly Lyons: [Kelly](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/) provides leadership and strategic guidance for the Toronto Data Lab. She is an expert in information and computer science, in particular, the field of service science. Her experience in both academia and industry mean that she is as comfortable writing code as she is writing values statements.

## Industry affiliates

- Sharla Gelfand: [Sharla](https://sharla.party/) ensures the Lab contributes to, and aligns with, the needs of industry and society. Their creativity and expertise with all things R and applied statistics provides invaluable guidance for all members of the Lab.

## Graduate students

Graduate students are equal partners, have considerable autonomy, are given co-authorship, and are paid. Graduate students take ownership of their project and contribute critically to its success.

### Current

- **A Mahfouz**
    - `dlarXiv`: This R package makes it easier to responsibly download papers from arXiv.
    - 'Discussions of bias in AI/ML research': In this paper we gather a sample of recent AI/ML research and use natural language processing to understand the extent to which bias, in an ethical rather than statistical sense, is considered.
    - 'Communicating geographically-based Bayesian models': In this paper we introduce a method to communicate the geographic results of Bayesian models. 
- **Diego Mamanche Castellanos**
    - 'Understanding OCR in the context of a broader statistical workflow': In this paper we examine various optical character recognition (OCR) options, and how their outputs affect subsequent statistical analysis.
- **Hidaya Ismail**
    - 'Bias in TikTok': We gather and examine data from TikTok to understand the role of bias.
- **Ke-Li Chiu**
    - 'Consistency scores in text data': In this paper we introduce a process to clean the text extracted from PDFs using various methods from natural language processing.
- **Paul Hodgetts**
    - `cesR`: This R package makes it easier to gather and use the Canadian Election Study surveys from 1965 through to 2019.

If you are a U of T student and would like to join the lab then we advertise for positions from time to time and you should keep an eye out for those. Impressive applicants have GitHub repos that show off their best work.
