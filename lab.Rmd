The Toronto Data Lab exists to:

1. conduct research at the intersection of information and statistical sciences; 
2. bring together researchers and practitioners from various academic disciplines and industry; and
3. provide high-quality training opportunities for students.

The lab organises the Toronto Data Workshop, which everyone is welcome to attend - sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8). We also maintain an internal reading group and presentation schedule.

## Director/PI

- Rohan Alexander.

## Faculty affiliates

- [Professor Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/).

## Industry affiliates

- [Sharla Gelfand](https://sharla.party/).

## Students

Students are equal partners, have considerable autonomy, are given co-authorship, and are paid. They take ownership of their project and contribute critically to its success.

### Current

- **A Mahfouz** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto with a background in geography. Their prior work has been largely concerned with data pipelines. A has contributed to many projects including: 1) [`arxivdl`](https://amfz.github.io/arxivdl/) which is an R package that makes it easier to responsibly download papers from arXiv. 2) 'Discussions of bias in AI/ML research': In this paper we gather a sample of recent AI/ML research and use natural language processing to understand the extent to which bias, in an ethical rather than statistical sense, is considered. 3) 'Communicating geographically-based Bayesian models': In this paper we introduce a method to communicate the geographic results of Bayesian models. 
- **Dan Xu** is a doctoral student in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. His research focus is on misinformation propagation in politics, broadly defined.
- **Diego Mamanche Castellanos** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto with more than six years of experience in financial companies. Diego is focused on the paper, 'Understanding OCR in the context of a broader statistical workflow'. In this paper we examine various optical character recognition (OCR) options, and how their outputs affect subsequent statistical analysis.
- **Hidaya Ismail** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto. Hidaya focuses on extracting and organising data from websites, in particular the project, AustralianPoliticians.
- **Ke-Li Chiu** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto. She is focused on 'Consistency scores in text data' and aRianna. In this paper we introduce a process to clean the text extracted from PDFs using various methods from natural language processing.
- **Paul Hodgetts** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto. Paul contributed to `cesR`: This R package makes it easier to gather and use the Canadian Election Study surveys from 1965 through to 2019. A pre-print is available here: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a29h8/ and the package is available here: https://github.com/hodgettsp/cesR.
- **Yian Wang** is an undergraduate student studying for an Honours Bachelor of Science degree with majors in statistics and economics and a minor in mathematics. Currently using her experience in R, Python, and Julia to aid in various projects.


If you are a U of T student and would like to join the lab then we advertise for positions from time to time and you should keep an eye out for those. Impressive applicants have GitHub repos that show off their best work.
