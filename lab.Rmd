# Overview 

My research group exists to:

1. conduct research at the intersection of information and statistical sciences; 
2. bring together researchers and practitioners from various academic disciplines and industry; and
3. provide high-quality training opportunities for students.

We organize the Toronto Data Workshop, which everyone is welcome to attend - sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8). We also maintain an internal reading group and presentation schedule.


# People 

## Faculty affiliates

- [Professor Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/).

## Industry affiliates

- [Sharla Gelfand](https://sharla.party/).

## Students

Students are equal partners, have considerable autonomy, are given co-authorship, and are paid. They take ownership of their project and contribute critically to its success.

### Current

- **A Mahfouz** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto with a background in geography. Their prior work has been largely concerned with data pipelines. A has contributed to many projects including: 1) [`arxivdl`](https://amfz.github.io/arxivdl/) which is an R package that makes it easier to responsibly download papers from arXiv. 2) 'Discussions of bias in AI/ML research': In this paper we gather a sample of recent AI/ML research and use natural language processing to understand the extent to which bias, in an ethical rather than statistical sense, is considered. 3) 'Communicating geographically-based Bayesian models': In this paper we introduce a method to communicate the geographic results of Bayesian models. 
- **Dan Xu** is a doctoral student in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. His research focus is on misinformation propagation in politics.
- **Diego Mamanche Castellanos** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto with more than six years of experience in financial companies. Diego is focused on the paper, 'Understanding OCR in the context of a broader statistical workflow'. In this paper we examine various optical character recognition (OCR) options, and how their outputs affect subsequent statistical analysis.
- **Hidaya Ismail** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto. Hidaya focuses on extracting and organising data from websites, in particular TikTok.
- **Ke-Li Chiu** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto. She is interested in natural language processing (NLP) and put together the `aRianna` R package and Shiny app for text cleaning and preparation described here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05225. Work in progress involves GPT-3.
- **Paul Hodgetts** is a Master of Information student at the University of Toronto. Paul put together `cesR`, which is an R package that makes it easier to gather and use the Canadian Election Study surveys from 1965 through to 2019, described here: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a29h8/. Work in progress involves estimates of stateless populations.
- **Yian Wang** is an undergraduate student studying for an Honours Bachelor of Science degree with majors in statistics and economics and a minor in mathematics. Yian is interested in surveys and current work involves understanding the effect of COVID shutdowns on the restaurant industry.



<!-- # FAQ -->

<!-- ### Current Toronto undergrad or masters students -->

<!-- If you are a Toronto undergrad or masters student and would like to work with me, then the best way is to do well in a course that I teach and then get in touch. However, I do advertise for positions from time to time and you should also keep an eye out for those. Impressive applicants have: -->

<!-- 1) GitHub repos that show off their best work. -->
<!-- 2) Exceptional written communication skills. -->
<!-- 3) Support the claims they make in a cover letter with evidence. -->


<!-- ### Current Toronto PhD students -->

<!-- I am open to supervising PhD students. If you are already admitted, then please email me. -->

<!-- ### Prospective PhD students -->


<!-- If you are not yet a Toronto PhD student: -->

<!-- - Thank you for reaching out! Having gone through it myself, I do understand that grad school applications are stressful and there is a lot of conflicting advice. -->
<!-- - I am open to supervising PhD students, but can only help once you are admitted. Admission decisions are made at a department/faculty level and there is little I can do to help you until you're in. While I understand that practices differ across fields and universities, in my case, there is no point contacting me until you're admitted. -->

<!-- - Again, the first step is to apply and be admitted into the PhD program. In my case that likely means either [Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/future-students/apply/phd-apply/) or [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate/phd-application-information). -->
<!-- - As part of the application you'll have the option to list faculty with whom you would like to work, and you can certainly put my name down. -->
<!-- - Again, after you are admitted to the program I will have all the time in the world for you, but until then there's little that I can do because these decisions are made at a department/faculty level. -->


<!-- ### Reference letters -->

<!-- I can only provide reference letters to students that work with me or got an A+ in a course that I taught. This is because I only write reference letters that very strongly recommend you and I can only confidently strongly recommend you if you're in one of those two buckets.  -->

<!-- If I've worked with you or you got an A+ in a course that I taught then I'd be happy to write you references and I will need:  -->

<!-- 1) at least two week's notice;  -->
<!-- 2) a unofficial copy of your entire Toronto transcript;  -->
<!-- 3) a copy of your CV; -->
<!-- 4) a list of the marks that you got in my problem sets and a copy of your submissions for those problem sets;  -->
<!-- 5) a list of the programs that you're applying for;  -->
<!-- 6) three or four paragraphs where you talk about yourself in third person (this is: 1) to ensure that I use the correct names, pronouns etc; 2) to better understand what role I play - am I the 'stats' or 'information' reference for you, am I the 'academic' or the 'work' reference; 3) to give me something to start from). -->

<!-- Finally, writing references is part of my job. There's not need to feel bad about asking, and there's no need for gifts - while I appreciate the gesture, it's not appropriate - a thank you email is more than sufficient. -->
