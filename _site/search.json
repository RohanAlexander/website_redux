I use quantitative methods to explore human-centered questions with an emphasis on data concerns. I am interested in not only statistical science, that is, drawing quantitative inferences from real-world data, but also in information science, through my emphasis on all aspects of obtaining, preparing, storing, and sharing data.\nMy work is arranged around three tranches:\nMultilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP).\nNatural language processing (NLP).\nStatistical workflow.\nPublished papers\nRohan Alexander and Zach Ward, 2018, ‘Age at Arrival and Assimilation During the Age of Mass Migration’, The Journal of Economic History, 78(3), 904-937.Working paper version.\nWorking papers\nMonica Alexander and Rohan Alexander, ‘The Effect of Elections and Prime Ministers on Discussion in the Australian Federal Parliament (1901—2018)’.\nPaul A.

      "contents": "\n-“A Little Life”, Hanya Yanighara. Recommended by Lauren.\n“The Andromeda Strain”, Michael Crichton.\n“Is There Life After Housework”, Don Aslett.\nGot given this at the Museum of Clean in Pocatello, Idaho. The museum was surprisingly good!\n“The Chosen”, Chaim Potok.\n“The Forsyth Saga”, John Galsworthy.\n“Freakonomics”, Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner.\n“Tess of the D’Urbervilles”, Thomas Hardy.\n“King Charles III”, Anthony Holden.\n“The Road Washes Out in Spring”, Baron Wormser.\nStayed at the author’s house, so bought some of his books and particularly liked this one about how his family lived off the grid in New England. Liked it even better after living in Amherst for a while.\n“The Shepherd’s Hut”, Tim Winton.\nPresent from Helen.\n“Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software”, Charles Petzold.\n“Hitch-22”, Christopher Hitchens.\n“Audacity of Hope”, Barack Obama.\n“Kennedy”, Ted Sorenson.\n“The Son Also Rises”, Greg Clark.\n“My Life”, Bill Clinton.\n“The Art of the Deal”, Donald Trump and Tony Schwartz. This book is terrible. Read that NYT article about how he really made his money instead.\n“Life, on the Line”, Grant Achatz and Nick Kokonas.\n“The Pelican Brief”, John Grisham.\n“Cameron”, Francis Elliot and James Hanning. I haven’t yet come across a good David Cameron biography, but this one was interesting. Focused on pre-parliament period.\n“Lightning Rods”, Helen DeWitt.\n“All Too Human”, George Stephanopoulos. I thought that politics was romantic until I read this book when I was 20.\n“Hansons Half-Marathon Method”, Luke Humphrey.\n“The Remains of the Day”, Kazuo Ishiguro.\n“An Equal Music”, Vikram Seth.\n-“Zero to One”, Peter Thiel. Maybe it’s the jet-lag, but is this a business book that’s actually not terrible? A few weak chapters, but enough interesting ones to outweigh them.\n“Harry Potter”, J. K. Rowling.\n“The Book of Basketball”, Bill Simmons.\n“The Crime of the Century”, Kingsley Amis.\n-“Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup”, John Carreyrou. About Theranos, a company that faked blood test results.\n“Hansons Marathon Method”, Luke Humphrey. Bought this; followed this; ran my best marathon.\n“Moneyball”, Michael Lewis.\n-“Devil’s Bargain”, Joshua Green. About Bannon and his relationship with Trump. Worthwhile reading in and of itself, but the interaction with ‘Chasing Hillary’ was especially good. Neither is quantitative, but both help to understand 2016 e.g. how could the Comey reopening have a statistical effect? Green shows Bannon spent years creating specific mainstream doubts re Clinton. Chozick shows how/why Clinton campaign decisions accentuated them. I’m as keen on quant political analysis as anyone (shout out to @petitpoll if you want Australian polling!), but the snippets (and there was not much unfortunately) about each campaign’s quant groups made me wonder if we have a cohort issue ATM. Specifically, do those in charge of political campaigns (or for that matter many businesses) know enough quant to know it’s important, but not enough to appreciate, and hence be able to compensate for, it’s weaknesses?\n“The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest”, Stieg Larsson.\n“Island Home”, Tim Winton.\n“One Bullet Away”, Nathaniel Fick.\n“The Tenth Man”, Graham Green.\n“The Sound of One Hand Clapping”, Richard Flanagan. Present from Helen.\n“Berkeley Walks”, Robert E Johnson and Janet L Byron.\n“Some Trick”, Helen DeWitt.\n“Why Australia Prospered”, Ian McLean.\n“R for Data Science”, Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Some people convert to Catholicism when they get married, I converted to R. But my knowledge was piecemeal and going through this book addressed that.\n“Middlesex”, Jeffrey Eugenides.\n“The Last Samurai”, Helen DeWitt. Nothing to do with the Tom Cruise movie.\n“The Unconsoled”, Kazuo Ishiguro.\n“The English Patient”, Michael Ondaatje.\n“The Zhivago Affair”, Peter Finn and Petra Couvée. Present from Bec.\n“The Buried Giant”, Kazuo Ishiguro.\n“The Princess Casamassima”, Henry James.\n“Swan Song”, John Galsworthy.\n“The Golden Gate”, Vikram Seth.\n“Dilbert”, Scott Adams.\n“A Thousand Days”, Arthur Schlesinger.\n“Gone Girl”, Gillian Flynn.\n“Manufacturing Consent”, Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky.\n“The Making of the Atomic Bomb”, Richard Rhodes. Covers the physical, social, and political factors that culminated in the US dropping atomic bombs on Japan at the end of World War II.\n“The Moor’s Last Sigh”, Salman Rushdie.\n“Blood Year”, David Kilcullen.\n“Vanity Fair”, William Thackeray.\n“The Canterbury Tales”, Geoffrey Chaucer.\n“The Poetry Life: Ten Stories”, Baron Wormser.\n“Vineland”, Thomas Pynchon.\n“Fables”, Aesop.\n“Runner’s World The Runner’s Body”, Ross Tucker and Jonathan Dugas.\n“Decoded”, Jay Z.\n“A Perfect Spy”, John le Carré. Dad likes le Carré so I buy them when there’s a nice edition.\n“What a Croc: Legendary Front Pages From the NT News”. Present from Mark.\n“The Summons”, John Grisham.\n“Seven Pillars of Wisdom”, TE Lawrence. ‘Borrowed’ from Dad.\n“Cloudstreet”, Tim Winton. All Australians have a copy of this. I think it’s in the law or something.\n“The Noma Guide to Fermentation”, Rene Redzepi and David Zilber.\n“Alice Waters and Chez Panisse”, Thomas McNamee.\n“The Junior Officers’ Reading Club”, Patrick Hennessey.\n“Rumpole”, John Mortimer.\n-“The Dream Machine”, M. Mitchell Waldrop.\n“The Loved One”, Evelyn Waugh.\n“The Challenger Launch Decision”, Diane Vaughan. One of the greatest non-fiction books ever.\n“Purity”, Jonathan Franzen. Bought this while I was in Oakland, mostly because the main character lived in Oakland.\n“The Information”, Martin Amis.\n-“Hard Landing”, Thomas Petzinger. About the deregulation of the US airline market.\n“The Best and the Brightest”, David Halberstam. I read Plato’s Republic at an impressionable age and so I used to think that if we could just put the smart people in charge then the ‘right’ decisions would be made. This book cured me of that.\n“Our Game”, John le Carré.\n“Margaret Thatcher”, Charles Moore. Present from Dad\n“The Rosie Project”, Graeme Simson.\n“End of the Chapter”, John Galsworthy.\n“Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel Hierarchical Models”, Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill. Ah, the money-maker! Thank you Gelman and Hill. I haven’t properly studied this book, just dipped in and out as needed, but Monica’s probably read it more than enough for both of us.\n“Middlemarch”, George Eliot.\n“War and Peace”, Leo Tolstoy.\n“Open”, Andre Agassi. Tennis is incidental to the aspects that make this book great, so try it even if you don’t particularly like the sport. I can’t remember who recommended it – seems like a Nick Crocker type of book?\n“Introduction to Statistical Learning”, Daniela Witten, Gareth James, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie. Going through this with Peter taught me a lot including: 1) if you want to learn something then buy a physical copy of a textbook, get a partner and commit to weekly chapter reviews; 2) learn statistics from statisticians; and 3) statistics is awesome and I want to learn more. I always thought that I was terrible at it because econometrics never came easily to me, but now I realise that maybe the econometrics-approach isn’t for me, but the statistics one is.\n“A Thousand Days”, Arthur Schlesinger.\n-“The Pixar Touch”, David A. Price. Incredible details about their overnight success, 23 years in the making.\n“Stop At Nothing”, Annabel Crabb.\n-“Fire and Ashes: Success and Failure in Politics”, Michael Ignatieff. Changed the way that I thought about politics.\n“Political Animal”, David Marr.\n“Triumph and Demise”, Paul Kelly. Present from Dad.\n“Skyfaring”, Mark Vanhoenacker. Read this on your next flight.\n“A Suitable Boy”, Vikram Seth.\n-“Chasing Hillary”, Amy Chozick. Extended 2016 Clinton campaign diary. Many (most?) campaign dairies are terrible but this is worthwhile reading in and of itself and the interaction with ‘Devil’s Bargain’ was especially good. See notes for ‘Devil’s Bargain’.\n“Stress Test”, Timothy Geithner.\n“Elements of Statistical Learning”, Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie.\n“Officers and Gentlemen”, Evelyn Waugh.\nBest books that I read in:\n2019\nHahahahaha, the baby was born in 2019.\n\n2018:\n“Bad Blood” John Carreyrou;\n“Devil’s Bargain” Joshua Green & “Chasing Hillary” Amy Chozick;\n“Hard Landing” Thomas Petzinger;\n“Open” Andre Agassi;\n“Some Trick” Helen DeWitt;\n“The Dream Machine” M Mitchell Waldrop; and\n“The Pixar Touch” David A Price.\n\n",

For their support of this call we thank: the PIE Fund, and especially Bethany White and Radu Craiu from the Department of Statistical Sciences (DoSS).\nCall for applications\n10 October 2020\nAre you an undergraduate or graduate student at the Univeristy of Toronto? Would you like to work with Sam-Jo Caetano and Rohan Alexander to help put together a toolkit for applied statistics? It’s focused on R essentials such as ggplot, tidyverse, GitHub, and all their friends.\nIf so, please send an email to rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca with the subject line ‘DoSS toolkit application’. Please attach one PDF that contains both a cover letter and a CV. As part of your cover letter, please include a link to a GitHub repo showing off some code that you’ve written, or if you don’t have that, a blogpost you’ve written that is of a statistical/quantitative/technical nature.\nApplications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, but the final deadline to apply is the end of Wednesday, 21 October 2020.\nThe normal RA hourly rate and conditions will apply.\nApplications from people that have been under-represented in statistical sciences are particularly encouraged.\nBy way of background, we are looking to employ a small team of undergraduate and graduate students to help build a set of instructional material about R that will be used across DoSS starting in Winter (and hopefully soon after that, the broader university and community). This will build on work already done by a bunch of DoSS folks including Bethany White and Nathan Taback, and of course build on and complement the first-year courses.\nYou will help put together written material, videos, and assessment. You will be credited as a contributor to what will be a public-facing resource. You will have a chance to develop your R, teaching, and communication skills, as well as gain experience working in a small team.\nWe expect you to have some familiarity with R (i.e. have used it for a course or two), but you do NOT need to be an R expert. Indeed some successful applications may be in their first term with R.\nThe majority of the work will occur in early/mid November, but your appointment will run from November through to January to help deal with any lingering minor issues. The total time commitment would vary from 20 to 60 hours, depending on your circumstances and availability. The work is flexible and can be done at a time that suits you. Given we are in a pandemic, the work will be conducted remotely. Most day-to-day management will occur through Slack and GitHub.\nWe hope you apply!\nRohan and Sam\n\n\n\n",

I am also a faculty affiliate at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society.\nMy academic work typically involves first constructing new datasets in a reproducible way, drawing on methods including digitization, record matching, survey collection, and web-scraping. After constructing datasets, I then typically use quantitative methods to analyse the large amounts of information contained in them, drawing on techniques from natural language processing, machine learning, and Bayesian methods, as appropriate. As my work is focused on individuals, issues of privacy and consent are of critical importance, and exist within my broader research interests in the intersection of data and ethics. Additionally, I develop open science best practises that help enhance reproducibility and replicability, as well as understanding.\nThe Toronto Data Lab exists to bring this all together and provide opportunities for the training of graduate students.\nI enjoy teaching and aim to help students from a wide range of backgrounds learn how to tell stories with data. The notes that support my teaching are available here: https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/. In Fall 2020 I am teaching ‘Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data’ in Statistical Sciences; and in Winter 2021 I am teaching ‘Experimental Design’ in Information and will also be leading a reading course ‘Ethics and Data Science’. I am an RStudio Certified Tidyverse Trainer.\nI co-founded the weekly Toronto Data Workshop, which is more fun than it sounds. All welcome! Sign up here.\nWith Lauren Kennedy at Monash University, I co-organize a weekly MRP Reading Group. Please get in touch if you’d like to attend.\n\nFinally, I probably spend too much money on books, and certainly too much time at libraries (in a pre-COVID world). You can see some of the books that I recommend here. If you have any book recommendations of your own, I’ve love to hear them.\nAcademic CV\n\n\n\n",

Petit Poll combines non-representative polling data with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling. I am responsible for survey design and analysis, as well as marketing and communication.\nWe polled the 2016 Australian Federal election and got a (statistically) reasonable result. In terms of seats we were five off. Four of those were just a result of our small sample size: there were the three that turned unexpectedly in Tasmania; and the one in South Australia that went to the Nick Xenophon team. If we had more data from those areas then the model would have had a better chance, but when there’s not much data the prior has a big impact.\nGrosvenor Public Sector Advisory\nConsultant, April 2017 – February 2019\nI consulted at Grosvenor on a casual basis to complete a specific project for the European Commission relating to public procurement. This involved: identifying data sources; preparing for and supporting data acquisition; conducting data quality confirmation; helping with survey design and validation; and some minor managerial responsibilities.\nThe Centre for International Economics\nEconomist, January 2012 – August 2013; August 2015 – November 2015\nThe CIE is a privately-owned economic consultancy. I contributed to reports for public- and private-sector clients as part of a small team. Topics included: valuing public sector outputs; housing sector taxation; the global meat market; wheat price elasticities; variations to modern awards; migration; and labor markets.\nGoCampaign\nCo-founder and Director, July 2011 – May 2015\nAs a co-founder and director of GoCampaign (later GoCatalyze), a data analysis tool, I was responsible for the creation and development of a business along with Andrew Barnes, Chris Eigeland and Chris Hood. There were many aspects to this including creating marketing material and websites; making pitch decks; customer on-boarding and service; presenting; market testing; and some minor managerial responsibilities. GoCatalyze completed the ANZ Innovyz START accelerator program in 2013 and won the iAward Data Category in 2014. GoCatalyze is now part of GO1.\nReserve Bank of Australia\nCadet/Analyst/Senior Analyst, February 2009 – December 2011\nI researched topics related to banknotes, for example an econometric analysis of banknote demand during the 2007-08 financial crisis.

The conference will be hosted online on Thursday and Friday 25-26 February 2021. Everyone is welcome and you can register here.\nKeynotes:\nEva Vivalt (University of Toronto);\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel (University of Edinburgh); and\nRiana Minocher (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology).\nInvited presentations:\nAmber Simpson (Queen’s University);\nFlorencia D’Andrea (Argentine National Institute of Agricultural Technology);\nGarret Christensen (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation);\nHeidi Seibold (Helmholtz AI);\nJohn McLevey (University of Waterloo);\nLauren Kennedy (Monash University);\nMonica Alexander (University of Toronto);\nNancy Reid (University of Toronto);\nRyan Briggs (University of Guelph);\nSharla Gelfand (Freelance R Developer);\nShemra Rizzo (Genentech);\nShiro Kuriwaki (Harvard University); and\nTyler Girard (Western University).\nIf you would like to attend, then please register here.\nCall for abstracts\nIf you would like to present a paper then please register and submit an abstract here. Abstracts are due 15 December 2020. Notification of acceptance will occur a week or two after that.\nFolks who have traditionally been under-represented in statistics are especially encouraged to apply.\nWe welcome anything to do with reproducibility, but the conference has four broad areas of focus:\nApplications of reproducibility: Do you have an example and/or case studies of especially reproducible work? What are these gold standards, what makes them great, and how can we all achieve this standard?\nEvaluating reproducibility: Have you tried to systematically look at the extent of reproducibility in a field? Does, say, economics fall flat while demography shines? How did you go about your study? What aspects contributed to your findings?\nPractices of reproducibility: Have you developed some tools and approaches that make reproducibility easier?\nTeaching reproducibility: How can we ensure that today’s undergraduate and graduate students don’t repeat the mistakes of earlier generations? What are some case studies that show promise?\nDetails\nFree and online via Zoom.\nEveryone is welcome. You don’t need to be affiliated with a university.\nIf you would like to attend, then please sign up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A recording of that will be uploaded. I will run the lab (11am-noon), which will just focus on dealing with any installation issues. As that’s more specific to individuals I won’t record that.\nThe core of the course is in the notes that I will provide links to. You should go through these in detail. Run the examples. Try to change them slightly and see what happens. Do the readings that you are interested in. Read the help docs for the functions. This is the core of your learning. Lectures mostly just exist for you to have a chance to discuss your thoughts with me.\nRead & write - that is the life that you have signed up for. When it comes to this course, if you are not reading or writing, then you are almost surely wasting your time.\nThis week is about ensuring that you have an appropriate foundation on which we can build the rest of the course.

We meet weekly for an hour and aim to have a roughly even split of participants from academia and industry over the course of each term.\nWe meet on Thursdays at 4-5pm (Toronto time) via Zoom. For an invitation please sign up here. Anyone is welcome to attend - you don’t need to be affiliated with the university. We start at 4:01 with a brief welcome and then three minutes of break-out rooms to meet some of the other participants. At 4:05 we return to the main room and the speaker is introduced. Speakers typically speak for 20-45 minutes, during which participants are encouraged to add comments and questions to the chat, rather than verbally interrupting. We then have a chaired question period, in which those with questions are asked to signal this in the chat, at which point they’ll be called on to introduce themselves and ask their question.\nThe current organising committee is: Faria Khandaker, Kelly Lyons, and Rohan Alexander.
