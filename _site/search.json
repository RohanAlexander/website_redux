I use quantitative methods to explore human-centered questions with an emphasis on data concerns. I am interested in not only statistical science, that is, drawing quantitative inferences from real-world data, but also in information science, through my emphasis on all aspects of obtaining, preparing, storing, and sharing data.\nMy work is arranged around three tranches:\nMultilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP).\nNatural language processing (NLP).\nStatistical workflow.\nPublished papers\nRohan Alexander and Zach Ward, 2018, ‘Age at Arrival and Assimilation During the Age of Mass Migration’, The Journal of Economic History, 78(3), 904-937.Working paper version.\nWorking papers\nMonica Alexander and Rohan Alexander, ‘The Effect of Elections and Prime Ministers on Discussion in the Australian Federal Parliament (1901—2018)’.\nPaul A.

About Theranos, a company that faked blood test results.\n“Hansons Marathon Method”, Luke Humphrey. Bought this; followed this; ran my best marathon.\n“Moneyball”, Michael Lewis.\n-“Devil’s Bargain”, Joshua Green. About Bannon and his relationship with Trump. Worthwhile reading in and of itself, but the interaction with ‘Chasing Hillary’ was especially good. Neither is quantitative, but both help to understand 2016 e.g. how could the Comey reopening have a statistical effect? Green shows Bannon spent years creating specific mainstream doubts re Clinton. Chozick shows how/why Clinton campaign decisions accentuated them. I’m as keen on quant political analysis as anyone (shout out to @petitpoll if you want Australian polling!), but the snippets (and there was not much unfortunately) about each campaign’s quant groups made me wonder if we have a cohort issue ATM. Specifically, do those in charge of political campaigns (or for that matter many businesses) know enough quant to know it’s important, but not enough to appreciate, and hence be able to compensate for, it’s weaknesses?\n“The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest”, Stieg Larsson.\n“Island Home”, Tim Winton.\n“One Bullet Away”, Nathaniel Fick.\n“The Tenth Man”, Graham Green.\n“The Sound of One Hand Clapping”, Richard Flanagan.

About the deregulation of the US airline market.\n“The Best and the Brightest”, David Halberstam. I read Plato’s Republic at an impressionable age and so I used to think that if we could just put the smart people in charge then the ‘right’ decisions would be made.

Present from Dad\n“The Rosie Project”, Graeme Simson.\n“End of the Chapter”, John Galsworthy.\n“Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel Hierarchical Models”, Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill. Ah, the money-maker! Thank you Gelman and Hill. I haven’t properly studied this book, just dipped in and out as needed, but Monica’s probably read it more than enough for both of us.\n“Middlemarch”, George Eliot.\n“War and Peace”, Leo Tolstoy.\n“Open”, Andre Agassi. Tennis is incidental to the aspects that make this book great, so try it even if you don’t particularly like the sport. I can’t remember who recommended it – seems like a Nick Crocker type of book?\n“Introduction to Statistical Learning”, Daniela Witten, Gareth James, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie. Going through this with Peter taught me a lot including: 1) if you want to learn something then buy a physical copy of a textbook, get a partner and commit to weekly chapter reviews; 2) learn statistics from statisticians; and 3) statistics is awesome and I want to learn more. I always thought that I was terrible at it because econometrics never came easily to me, but now I realise that maybe the econometrics-approach isn’t for me, but the statistics one is.\n“A Thousand Days”, Arthur Schlesinger.\n-“The Pixar Touch”, David A.

For their support of this call we thank: the PIE Fund, and especially Bethany White and Radu Craiu from the Department of Statistical Sciences (DoSS).\nCall for applications\n10 October 2020\nAre you an undergraduate or graduate student at the Univeristy of Toronto? Would you like to work with Sam-Jo Caetano and Rohan Alexander to help put together a toolkit for applied statistics? It’s focused on R essentials such as ggplot, tidyverse, GitHub, and all their friends.\nIf so, please send an email to rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca with the subject line ‘DoSS toolkit application’. Please attach one PDF that contains both a cover letter and a CV. As part of your cover letter, please include a link to a GitHub repo showing off some code that you’ve written, or if you don’t have that, a blogpost you’ve written that is of a statistical/quantitative/technical nature.\nApplications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, but the final deadline to apply is the end of Wednesday, 21 October 2020.\nThe normal RA hourly rate and conditions will apply.\nApplications from people that have been under-represented in statistical sciences are particularly encouraged.\nBy way of background, we are looking to employ a small team of undergraduate and graduate students to help build a set of instructional material about R that will be used across DoSS starting in Winter (and hopefully soon after that, the broader university and community). This will build on work already done by a bunch of DoSS folks including Bethany White and Nathan Taback, and of course build on and complement the first-year courses.\nYou will help put together written material, videos, and assessment. You will be credited as a contributor to what will be a public-facing resource. You will have a chance to develop your R, teaching, and communication skills, as well as gain experience working in a small team.\nWe expect you to have some familiarity with R (i.e. have used it for a course or two), but you do NOT need to be an R expert. Indeed some successful applications may be in their first term with R.\nThe majority of the work will occur in early/mid November, but your appointment will run from November through to January to help deal with any lingering minor issues. The total time commitment would vary from 20 to 60 hours, depending on your circumstances and availability. The work is flexible and can be done at a time that suits you. Given we are in a pandemic, the work will be conducted remotely. Most day-to-day management will occur through Slack and GitHub.\nWe hope you apply!\nRohan and Sam\n\n\n\n",

I am a faculty affiliate at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society.\nMy academic work typically involves first constructing new datasets in a reproducible way, drawing on methods including digitization, record matching, survey collection, and web-scraping. After constructing datasets, I then typically use quantitative methods to analyse the large amounts of information contained in them, drawing on techniques from natural language processing, machine learning, and Bayesian methods, as appropriate. As my work is focused on individuals, issues of privacy and consent are of critical importance, and exist within my broader research interests in the intersection of data and ethics. My research group exists to bring this all together and provide opportunities for the training of graduate students.\nI enjoy teaching and aim to help students from a wide range of backgrounds learn how to tell stories with data. In Winter 2021 I am teaching ‘Experimental Design’ in Information and leading a reading course ‘Ethics and Data Science’. I am an RStudio Certified Tidyverse Trainer.\nI co-organize the weekly Toronto Data Workshop, which is more fun than it sounds. All welcome!

There will be major changes through to 11 January 2021, and minor changes after that.\nPreamble\nSyllabus\nTBA - released on 11 January 2021.\nOverview\nExperimental design has a long and robust tradition within traditional applications such as agriculture, medicine, physics, and chemistry. It allows us to speak of causality with confidence. Typically, these are situations in which control groups can be established, randomization is appropriate, and ethical concerns can be assuaged. Unfortunately, such a set-up is rarely possible in the full extent of the modern applications where we want to understand causality.\n\n\n\nSource: https://xkcd.com/2400/\nThis course covers the traditional approaches and statistical methods, but focuses on what to do when traditional experimental design methods cannot be implemented or are not appropriate (i.e. what feels like most of the time these days). We cover experiments in their modern guise especially the concerns that we might have when we can run them; but also methods that can provide some causal understanding even when we cannot conduct traditional experiments. Importantly, these approaches do not rely on ‘big data’ or fancy statistics, but instead on thoroughly interrogating the data that are available to get understanding through as simple means as possible.\nThis is a hands-on course in which you will conduct research projects using real-world data. This means that you will: obtain and clean relevant datasets; develop your own research questions; use the statistical techniques that you are introduced to in class to answer those questions; and finally communicate your results in a meaningful way. This course is designed around approaches that are used extensively in academia, government, and industry. Furthermore, it includes many aspects, such as data cleaning and preparation, that are critical, but rarely taught.\nThis course is different to many other courses at the University of Toronto. At the end of this course, you will have a portfolio of work that you could show off to a potential employer. You will have developed the skills to work successfully as an applied statistician or data scientist. And you will know how to fill gaps in your knowledge yourself. A lot of scholarships and jobs these days ask for GitHub and blog links etc to show off a portfolio of your work. This is the class that gives you a chance to develop these. It’s very important to having something to show that needs to go beyond what is done in a normal class.\nHow to succeed\nIn this course you will work in a self-directed, open-ended manner. Identify relevant areas of interest and then learn the skills that you need to explore those areas.\nTo successfully complete this course, you should expect to spend a large portion of your time reading and writing (both code and text). Deeply engage with the materials. Find a small study group and keep each other motivated and focused. At the start of the week, read the course notes, all compulsory materials and some recommended materials based on your interest. After doing that, but before the ‘lecture’ time you should complete the weekly quiz. During ‘lectures’ I’ll live-code, discuss materials in the course notes, talk about an experiment, and you’ll have a chance to discuss the materials with me.\nYou need to be more active in your learning in this course than others - read the notes and related materials - and then go out there and teach yourself more and apply it. You will not be spoon-fed in this course. Each week try to write reproducible, understandable, R code surrounded by beautifully crafted text that motivates, backgrounds, explains, discusses and criticizes. Make steady progress toward the assessment.\nThis is not a ‘bird course’. Typically, after the term is finished, students say that the course is difficult but rewarding. The TAs and I are always available to answer any questions. Please come to office hours!\nHow we’ll work\nThis webpage will provide almost all the guiding materials that you need and links to the relevant parts of the notes. The course notes are available here: https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com. Those contain notes and other material that you could go over. There is a course Slack for discussion. We’ll use Quercus really only for assessment submission and grading. I expect you to work professionally, and so we’ll try to use professional tools to the extent possible.\nA rough weekly flow for the course would be something like:\nRead the week’s course notes.\nRead/watch/listen to the compulsory materials.\nComplete the weekly quiz.\nAttend the lecture.\nAttend the lab.\nMake progress on a paper.\nAdvice from past students\nSuccessful past students have the following advice (completely unedited by me):\n‘Start reading and writing on a weekly basis, watch some videos on R and RMD but more importantly learn how to use Google.’\n‘Start early, find a group of people you trust enough to divide the work up fairly. Let people work to their strengths (people who know R should do the modelling, good writers should write most of the reports, etc.)’\n‘Not to worry if you don’t do well on the first problem set—the nature of the course is to build up skills overtime, and it’s meant to be challenging in the beginning. In the end, it is worth it because you learn very valuable applicable skills on how to write professional reports.’\n‘Work on your writing and direction following skills.’\n‘Look at the rubric. There were times that I lost marks because I didn’t follow the rubric properly. Go to office hours, they are very useful as you can ask your own question and also get answers to questions other people ask and you didn’t think of. Also, do the assignments to the best of your ability. You will lose marks if you don’t put in effort and the only person you’re hurting is yourself.’\n‘During lectures, focus more on the why the prof is doing what he’s doing. When he runs certain commands in R, figure out why that sequence of code gives what you want, because it’ll help adapt his code into your assignment code. just remembering what he’s doing in lecture becomes useless really quickly since the thought process matters more. also, start everything early.’\n‘Do this course when you really want to learn something and have a lot of time to working on it.’\n‘you need to be very skillful in RStudio and latex. Otherwise you would be struggling.’\n‘Try to incorporate the feedback given and read a looottttttttt. Also start early on the problem sets because they tend to take a lot of time. Don’t give up!’\n‘Find a good group for problem sets’\n‘If the assignments stay the same, I would tell students to approach this class from the perspective of ’storytelling with statistics’ rather than a statistics course. You need to use R, and Markdown, and have a solid understanding of concepts like regression and sampling, but more importantly you need to be able to interpret results and write about them in a way coherent and professional way.’\n‘do your readings’\n‘Definitely get ready to write reports’\n‘Echoing the people who said to read the rubrics and treat INF2178 as a storytelling with data course rather than INF1344 part 2. Let the point distribution rubric guide what parts of the paper to focus on/expand. And pay attention to the “telling stories” part of the site URL. The point of the papers isn’t to chuck every statistical method and cool R trick you know in there, it’s to practice building data-driven arguments that different audiences might actually care about. Last, the piece of advice I wish I had followed for the class: keep a log of things that you find confusing/cool/useful.’\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to the following who helped develop this course: Monica Alexander, Kelly Lyons, Sharla Gelfand, Faria Khandaker, Hidaya Ismail, A Mahfouz, Paul Hodgetts, Thomas Rosenthal.\nContent\nThe following is tentative and will update as we go through the term. Weeks 11 and 12 will be adjusted to make space for the content in earlier weeks to the extent necessary.\nEach week you should go through the course notes and all compulsory materials. During the lecture I will live-code various aspects. I will also discuss a case study, typically a paper. During the lab, a TA will either lead small group discussions or similarly lead other work. The lecture will be recorded and posted here, but again, it’s not enough to just watch that - you need to read and write yourself.\nWeek 1\n12 January 2021, ‘Drinking from a fire hose’.\nLecture: Hello world!, R Essentials, Workflow.\nCase Study: Fisher’s Lady Tasting Tea.\nLab: Go through DoSS Toolkit ‘White’ and ‘Yellow’ and discuss any issues with the TA.\nWeek 2\n19 January 2021, ‘Science-ing’.\nLecture: Remainder of Workflow, Graphs, tables and writing.\nCase Study: Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\nLab: Go through DoSS Toolkit ‘Green’ and discuss any issues with the TA.\nWeek 3\n26 January 2021, ‘Why, if ever I did fall off—which there’s no chance of—but if I did–’.\nLecture: Experiments, and treatment effects.\nCase Study: The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment in the United States (https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/oregon-health-insurance-experiment-united-states)\nLab:\nPlease pretend that you work as a junior analyst for a large consulting firm. Further, pretend that your consulting firm has taken a contract to put together a facial recognition model for the Canada Border Services Agency’s Inland Enforcement branch. Write five or six points with regard to your thoughts on this matter. What would you do and why? Then split into small groups and compare your points with others. Do you think the model would end up being implemented?\nWith the help of the TA, please conduct ‘face-to-face’ surveys (via Zoom). For this exercise, you will be randomly split into groups of two. You have two minutes in each group and will then be swapped to another group. One person is to survey the other person asking the following questions: i) ‘What is your gender?’, ii) ‘What is your age?’, iii) ‘What is your marital status?’, iv) ‘What is your income?’, v) ‘If an election were held today who would you vote for?’. After one person is done, then switch roles. When you are the questioner you should record all responses using a small CSV (but not the person’s name please). When you are the respondent you are welcome to not respond. You will cycle through this multiple times. At the end, please write a small reflection about: 1) as a respondent, how you felt answering these questions and the implications that you think this feeling may have for how survey questions are answered more generally; and 2) as a questioner, how difficult it was to code responses and the implications this may have for the dataset that we analyse.\n\nWeek 4\n2 February 2021, ‘(Data) hunter-gatherer’.\nLecture: Scraping, surveys, open data, etc.\nCase Study: Student Coaching: How Far Can Technology Go? (https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/student-coaching-how-far-can-technology-go)\nLab:\nPlease pretend you work for Netflix and you want to know more about why people subscribe (or don’t!) when prices change. Please design an experiment, discuss its key features and how you would implement it. Please pay special attention to sampling issues. Then simulate an outcome.\nFollowing the guidance of the TA, please scrape some data and discuss some ethical considerations around the dataset that you created. You may like to write a short blog post discussing the difference between data being public but scattered, and a consolidated dataset being public with reference to Kirkegaard and Bjerrekær, 2016, and Politou, Alepis, and Patsakis, 2018 (if you do that please do email a link to me out of interest).\n\nWeek 5\n9 February 2021, ‘IJALM - It’s Just A Linear Model’.\nLecture: Linear and logistic regression and tidymodels\nCase Study: Alain Cohn, Michel André Maréchal, David Tannenbaum, Christian Lukas Zünd, 2019, ‘Civic honesty around the globe’\nLab:\nPretend that you work for Loblaws as a data scientist and it is late March 2020. As part of normal monitoring, you have noticed that purchases of flour and pasta have increased substantially. You had been planning to increase the price of these items in April as part of a trial, but now your manager is not sure whether it is appropriate to conduct the trial. Please write five or six points with regard to your thoughts on this matter. What would you do and why?\nAnalyse the Toronto AirBNB dataset with guidance from the TA.\n\nReading Week\n\n\n\nWeek 6\n23 February 2021, ‘Celestial Navigation’.\nLecture: Simulation, power, RCTs and A/B testing.\nCase Study: Upworthy A/B tests of headlines.\nLab:\nFollowing the guidance of the TA, please use Blogdown to create a simple website and then design and execute a simple A/B test for your website using Netlify.\n\nWeek 7\n2 March 2021, ‘Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc’.\nLecture: DAGs, confounding, selection bias, and measurement bias.

Petit Poll combines non-representative polling data with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling. I am responsible for survey design and analysis, as well as marketing and communication.\nWe polled the 2016 Australian Federal election and got a (statistically) reasonable result. In terms of seats we were five off. Four of those were just a result of our small sample size: there were the three that turned unexpectedly in Tasmania; and the one in South Australia that went to the Nick Xenophon team. If we had more data from those areas then the model would have had a better chance, but when there’s not much data the prior has a big impact.\nGrosvenor Public Sector Advisory\nConsultant, April 2017 – February 2019\nI consulted at Grosvenor on a casual basis to complete a specific project for the European Commission relating to public procurement. This involved: identifying data sources; preparing for and supporting data acquisition; conducting data quality confirmation; helping with survey design and validation; and some minor managerial responsibilities.\nThe Centre for International Economics\nEconomist, January 2012 – August 2013; August 2015 – November 2015\nThe CIE is a privately-owned economic consultancy. I contributed to reports for public- and private-sector clients as part of a small team. Topics included: valuing public sector outputs; housing sector taxation; the global meat market; wheat price elasticities; variations to modern awards; migration; and labor markets.\nGoCampaign\nCo-founder and Director, July 2011 – May 2015\nAs a co-founder and director of GoCampaign (later GoCatalyze), a data analysis tool, I was responsible for the creation and development of a business along with Andrew Barnes, Chris Eigeland and Chris Hood. There were many aspects to this including creating marketing material and websites; making pitch decks; customer on-boarding and service; presenting; market testing; and some minor managerial responsibilities. GoCatalyze completed the ANZ Innovyz START accelerator program in 2013 and won the iAward Data Category in 2014. GoCatalyze is now part of GO1.\nReserve Bank of Australia\nCadet/Analyst/Senior Analyst, February 2009 – December 2011\nI researched topics related to banknotes, for example an econometric analysis of banknote demand during the 2007-08 financial crisis. I was also responsible for creating and analysing counterfeit banknote datasets, and gave banknote-related presentations to the public.\n\n\n\n",

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/230538.230561.\nTechnical\nTBD based on student interest.\nAssessment\nFour ethical and technical blog posts (30 per cent)\nOver the course of the term, you are expected to submit four blog posts that each comprise two aspects: 1) ethical and 2) technical. These two aspects should be related to each other. You must submit all four, but only your best three blog posts will count, that is each blog post will account for 10 per cent of your overall mark.\nFor the first aspect (ethical), you are expected to write a moderate length discussion (think a paper of about two to three pages), of a reading, or set of readings, that we have covered over the past two weeks. Strong submissions will not limit themselves to reviewing a reading but will draw in larger issues and detail their own point of view.\nFor the second aspect (technical), you are expected to implement some small related technical aspect of what we have covered in the past two weeks. For instance, if we covered natural language processing then you may critically review a paper, and put together a chat bot.\nTo be clear, these two aspects should be related, tied together, and should be in the one blog post.\nYou should submit your blog post by emailing me a link to the relevant blog post on your website.\nThe proposed specific list of deadlines is:\nBlog post 1: midnight, Sunday 24 January, 2021.\nBlog post 2: midnight, Sunday 7 February, 2021.\nBlog post 3: midnight, Sunday 7 March, 2021.\nBlog post 4: midnight, Sunday 21 March, 2021.\nIn Week 1 we will discuss how these dates fit in with your other commitments and finalise them at that point.\nThe instructor will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline.\nPaper 1 (30 per cent)\nTask\nPlease gather and clean data on UofT salaries from the Sunshine List. Then conduct a Bayesian statistical analysis of your dataset to discuss the extent to which gender has an effect on salary. Finally please prepare a paper of around 10 pages that discusses your analysis. (Hint: gender is not explicitly part of the Sunshine List, you will need to grapple with what to do.)\nBackground\nYou should make appropriate use of appendices for additional and supporting material, and thoroughly reference your paper, but neither the appendices nor the reference list count toward your page limit. Your paper should have an appropriate title, author, date, abstract, and introduction. It should document and overview your dataset. It should clearly specify your model, and then discuss the results of your analysis and any weaknesses. Your analysis should be fully reproducible, with code and data hosted on a public GitHub repo. Additionally, you should include a thorough discussion of ethical considerations relevant to your analysis. This would likely take at least three pages, but you are welcome to write as much as is needed to make the points you would like to make. Likely the best way to do this is to include a brief overview of the ethical points that you would like to discuss, and then include the rest of the discussion in an appendix. I understand that Bayesian analysis may be new to you. I will assist you with putting together the model, but it is up to you to understand and interpret the output.\nSubmission\nTo submit your paper you should email me a link to a public GitHub repo. That repo should contain your paper in PDF format and all supporting code and data. Please send this email by midnight, Sunday, 14 February, 2021. Please do not make any changes to the repo after this. I will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline.\nPaper 2 (40 per cent)\nTask\nIn consultation with me, please identify an appropriate research question and data source that, like the requirement for Paper 1, combines both ethical and technical aspects. Please prepare a paper that represents your best attempt to answer this question and shows off your ability to engage in thoughtful, ethical, critique. The paper should be as long as necessary, although all extraneous material should be included in appendices. The expectation is that this paper should make an original contribution, that could be published in an academic journal.\nBackground\nPlease see the background provided for Paper 1, as this applies for Paper 2 as well.\nSubmission\nYou must send the email with the GitHub link to me by midnight, Sunday, 23 April, 2020. Please do not make any changes to the repo after this. I will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline. No extensions are possible because of deadlines for instructors to submit grades.\n\n\n\n",

The conference is free and will be hosted online on Thursday and Friday 25-26 February 2021. Everyone is welcome, you don’t need to be affiliated with a university, and you can register here.\nThe conference has three broad areas of focus:\nEvaluating reproducibility: Systematically looking at the extent of reproducibility of a paper or even in a whole field is important to understand where weaknesses exist. Does, say, economics fall flat while demography shines? How should we approach these reproductions? What aspects contribute to the extent of reproducibility.\nPractices of reproducibility: We need new tools and approaches that encourage us to think more deeply about reproducibility and integrate it into everyday practice.\nTeaching reproducibility: While it is probably too late for most of us, how can we ensure that today’s students don’t repeat our mistakes? What are some case studies that show promise? How can we ensure this doesn’t happen again?\nWe intend to record the presentations and will add links here after the conference. Again, the conference is free and online via Zoom, everyone is welcome - you don’t need to be affiliated with a university. If you would like to attend, then please sign up here.\nDraft schedule\n(All times are Toronto - same as US east coast / New York.)\nThursday, 25 February, 2021\nTime\nSpeaker\nFocus\n9:00-9:10am\nRohan Alexander, University of Toronto\nWelcome\n9:10-9:20am\nRadu Craiu, University of Toronto\nOpening remarks\n9:20-9:30am\nWendy Duff, University of Toronto\nOpening remarks\n9:30-10:25am\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel, University of Edinburgh\nKeynote - Teaching\n10:30-10:55am\nTyler Girard, University of Western Ontario\nTeaching\n11:00-11:25am\nShiro Kuriwaki, Harvard University\nTeaching\n11:30-11:55am\nTiffany Timbers, University of British Columbia\nTeaching\nNoon-12:55pm\nRiana Minocher, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology\nKeynote - Evaluating\n1:00-1:25pm\nBreak\n\n1:30-1:55pm\nTom Barton, Royal Holloway, University of London\nEvaluating\n2:00-2:25pm\nWijdan Tariq, University of Toronto\nEvaluating\n2:30-2:55pm\nMauricio Vargas, Catholic University of Chile & Nicolas Didier Arizona State University\nEvaluating\n3:00-3:25pm\nJake Bowers, University of Illinois & The Policy Lab\nPractices\n3:30-3:55pm\nDanielle Smalls-Perkins, Google\n\n4:00-4:25pm\nGarret Christensen, US FDIC\nEvaluating\n4:30-4:55pm\nYanbo Tang, University of Toronto\nPractices\n5:00-5:25pm\nLauren Kennedy, Monash University\n\n5:30-6:00pm\nFiona Fidler, University of Melbourne\nEvaluating\nFriday, 26 February, 2021\nTime\nSpeaker\nFocus\n8:00-8:30am\nNick Radcliffe, Stochastic Solutions Limited\nPractices\n8:30-9:00am\nJulia Schulte-Cloos, LMU Munich\nPractices\n9:00-9:25am\nSimeon Carstens, Tweag/IO\nPractices\n9:30-9:55am\nHeidi Seibold, Helmholtz AI Cooperation Unit\nPractices\n10:00-10:55am\nEva Vivalt, University of Toronto\nKeynote - Practices\n11:00-11:25am\nAndrés Cruz, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile\nPractices\n11:30-11:55am\nEmily Riederer, Capital One\nPractices\nNoon-12:25pm\nFlorencia D’Andrea, National Institute of Agricultural Technology\n\n12:30-12:55pm\nJohn Blischak, Freelance scientific software developer\nPractices\n1:00-1:25pm\nBreak\n\n1:30-1:55pm\nShemra Rizzo, Genentech\nPractices\n2:00-2:25pm\nAmber Simpson, Queens University\nPractices\n2:30-2:55pm\nJohn McLevey, University of Waterloo\n\n3:00-3:25pm\nSharla Gelfand, Freelance R Developer\nPractices\n3:30-3:55pm\nRyan Briggs, University of Guelph\nPractices\n4:00-4:25pm\nMonica Alexander, University of Toronto\nPractices\n4:30-4:55pm\nAnnie Collins, University of Toronto\nPractices\n5:00-5:25pm\nNancy Reid, University of Toronto\n\n5:30-6:00pm\nRohan Alexander, University of Toronto\nClosing remarks\nPresenter biographies and abstracts\nKeynotes:\nEva Vivalt is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Toronto. Her main research interests are in cash transfers, reducing barriers to evidence-based decision-making, and global priorities research.\nAbstract: TBA\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel is a Senior Lecturer in Statistics and Data Science in the School of Maths at University of Edinburgh, and currently on leave as Associate Professor of the Practice in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University as well as a Professional Educator and Data Scientist at RStudio.

Her work focuses on innovation in statistics pedagogy, with an emphasis on student-centered learning, computation, reproducible research, and open-source education.\nAbstract: TBA\nRiana Minocher is a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. She is an evolutionary biologist with broad interests. She has worked on a range of projects on human and non-human primate behaviour and ecology. She is particularly interested in the evolutionary processes that create and shape diversity between and within groups. Through her PhD research, she is keen on exploring the dynamics of cultural transmission and learning in human populations, to better understand the diverse patterns of behaviour we observe.\nAbstract: TBA\nInvited presentations:\nAmber Simpson is the Canada Research Chair in Biomedical Computing and Informatics and Associate Professor in the School of Computing (Faculty of Arts and Science) and Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences (Faculty of Health Sciences). She specializes in biomedical data science and computer-aided surgery. Her research group is focused on developing novel computational strategies for improving human health. She joined the Queen’s University faculty in 2019, after four years as faculty at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and three years as a Research Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. She is an American Association of Cancer Research award winner and the holder of multiple National Institutes of Health grants. She received her PhD in Computer Science from Queen’s University.\nAbstract: The development of predictive and prognostic biomarkers is a major area of investigation in cancer research. Our lab specializes in the development of quantitative imaging markers for personalized treatment of cancer. Progress in developing these novel markers is limited by a lack of optimization, standardization, and validation, all critical barriers to clinical use. This talk will describe our work in the repeatability and reproducibility of imaging biomarkers.\nAndrés Cruz is an adjunct instructor at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, where he teaches computational social science. He holds a BA and MA in Political Science, and is the co-editor of “R for Political Data Science: A Practical Guide” (CRC Press, 2020), an R manual for social science students and practitioners.\nAbstract: inexact is an RStudio addin to supervise fuzzy joins. Merging data sets is a simple procedure in most statistical software packages. However, applied researchers frequently face problems when dealing with data in which ID variables are not properly standardized. For instance, politicians’ names can be spelled differently in multiple sources (press reports, official documents, etc.), causing regular merging methods to fail. The most common approach to fix this issue when working with small and medium data sets is manually fixing the problematic values before merging. However, this solution is time-consuming and not reproducible. An RStudio addin called “inexact” was created to help with this. The package draws from approximate string matching algorithms, which quantify the distance between two given strings. When merging data sets with non-standardized ID variables, inexact users benefit from automatic match suggestions, while also being able to override the automatic choices when needed, using a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The output is simply code to perform the corrected merging procedure, which registers the employed algorithm and any corrections made by the user, ensuring reproducibility. A development version of inexact is available on GitHub.\nAnnie Collins is an undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics specializing in applied mathematics and statistics with a minor in history and philosophy of science. In her free time, she focusses her efforts on student governance, promoting women’s representation in STEM, and working with data in the non-profit and charitable sector.\nAbstract: TBA\nDanielle Smalls-Perkins works at Google in Natural Language Processing. She is a co-founder of MiR, which exists to support and increase the underrepresented minority users in the R community.\nAbstract: TBA\nEmily Riederer is a Senior Analytics Manager at Capital One. Her team focuses on reimagining our analytical infrastructure by building data products, elevating business analysis with novel data sources and statistical methods, and providing consultation and training to our partner teams.\nAbstract: Complex software systems make performance guarantees through documentation and unit tests, and they communicate these to users with conscientious interface design. However, published data tables exist in a gray area; they are static enough not to be considered a ‘service’ or ‘software’, yet too raw to earn attentive user interface design. This ambiguity creates a disconnect between data producers and consumers and poses a risk for analytical correctness and reproducibility. In this talk, I will explain how controlled vocabularies can be used to form contracts between data producers and data consumers. Explicitly embedding meaning in each component of variable names is a low-tech and low-friction approach which builds a shared understanding of how each field in the dataset is intended to work. Doing so can offload the burden of data producers by facilitating automated data validation and metadata management. At the same time, data consumers benefit by a reduction in the cognitive load to remember names, a deeper understanding of variable encoding, and opportunities to more efficiently analyze the resulting dataset. After discussing the theory of controlled vocabulary column-naming and related workflows, I will illustrate these ideas with a demonstration of the convo R package, which aids in the creation, upkeep, and application of controlled vocabularies. This talk is based on my related blog post and R package.\nFiona Fidler is a professor at the University of Melbourne, with a joint appointment in the Schools of BioSciences and History and Philosophy of Science. She is broadly interested in how experts, including scientists, make decisions and change their minds. Her past research has examined how methodological change occurs in different disciplines, including psychology, medicine and ecology, and developed methods for eliciting reliable expert judgements to improve decision making. She originally trained as a psychologist, and maintains a strong interest in psychological methods. She also has an abiding interest is statistical controversies, for example, the ongoing debate over Null Hypothesis Significance Testing. She is a current Australian Research Council Future Fellow, and leads the University of Melbourne’s Interdisciplinary MetaResearch Group (IMeRG), and the lead PI of the repliCATS project.\nAbstract: The repliCATS (Collaborative Assessments for Trustworthy Science) project is a meta-research project about scientific research practices and replication rates in science. We can’t afford to test and replicate every piece of research before it’s published and the aim of this project is to crowdsource group predictions of the replicability of 3,000 published research claims in the social and behavioural sciences. We use a structured group discussion method, the Investigate, Discuss, Estimage, Aggregate (IDEA) protocol, developed at the University of Melbourne, to develop accurate prediction methods of replicability that could be especially useful for end-users of research including policymakers.\nFlorencia D’Andrea is a post-doc at the Argentine National Institute of Agricultural Technology where she develops computer tools to assess the risk of pesticide applications for aquatic ecosystems. She holds a PhD in Biological Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nAbstract: TBA\nGarret Christensen received his economics PhD from UC Berkeley in 2011. He is an economist with the FDIC. Before that he worked for the Census Bureau, and he was a project scientist with the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences and a Data Science Fellow with the Berkeley Institute for Data Science.\nAbstract: Adoption of Open Science Practices is Increasing: Survey Evidence on Attitudes, Norms and Behavior in the Social Sciences. Has there been meaningful movement toward open science practices within the social sciences in recent years? Discussions about changes in practices such as posting data and pre-registering analyses have been marked by controversy—including controversy over the extent to which change has taken place. This study, based on the State of Social Science (3S) Survey, provides the first comprehensive assessment of awareness of, attitudes towards, perceived norms regarding, and adoption of open science practices within a broadly representative sample of scholars from four major social science disciplines: economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. We observe a steep increase in adoption: as of 2017, over 80% of scholars had used at least one such practice, rising from one quarter a decade earlier. Attitudes toward research transparency are on average similar between older and younger scholars, but the pace of change differs by field and methodology. According with theories of normal science and scientific change, the timing of increases in adoption coincides with technological innovations and institutional policies. Patterns are consistent with most scholars underestimating the trend toward open science in their discipline.\nHeidi Seibold is a Team leader at Helmholtz AI. Her group combines open science, AI and health research. It focuses on reproducible and open research, as well as on machine learning methods for personalized medicine that improve patient treatment.\nAbstract: In this talk I will discuss some practical steps for making your work reproducible. I will also share my thoughts on what role data scientists and statisticians can play in the reproducibility crisis.\nJake Bowers is a Senior Scientist at The Policy Lab and a member of the Lab’s data science practice. Jake is Associate Professor of Political Science and Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He has served as a Fellow in the Office of Evaluation Sciences in the General Services Administration of the US Federal Government and is Methods Director for the Evidence in Governance and Politics network. Jake holds a PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BA in Ethics, Politics and Economics from Yale University.\nAbstract: For evidence-based public policy to grow in impact and importance, practices to enhance scientific credibility should be brought into governmental contexts and also should be modified for those contexts. For example, few analyses of governmental data allow data sharing (in contrast with most scientific studies); and many analysis of governmental administrative data inform high stakes immediate decisions (in contrast with the slow accumulation of scientific knowledge). We make several proposals to adjust scientific norms of reproducibility and pre-registration to the policy context.\nJohn Blischak is a freelance scientific software developer for the life sciences industry. He is the primary author of the R package workflowr and the co-maintainer of the CRAN Task View on Reproducible Research. He received his PhD in Genetics from the University of Chicago.\nAbstract: The workflowr R package helps organize computational research in a way that promotes effective project management, reproducibility, collaboration, and sharing of results. workflowr combines literate programming (knitr and rmarkdown) and version control (Git, via git2r) to generate a website containing time-stamped, versioned, and documented results. Any R user can quickly and easily adopt workflowr, which includes four key features: (1) workflowr automatically creates a directory structure for organizing data, code, and results; (2) workflowr uses the version control system Git to track different versions of the code and results without the user needing to understand Git syntax; (3) to support reproducibility, workflowr automatically includes code version information in webpages displaying results and; (4) workflowr facilitates online Web hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages) to share results. Our goal is that workflowr will make it easier for researchers to organize and communicate reproducible results. Documentation and source code are available.\nJohn McLevey is an Associate Professor in the Department of Knowledge Integration at University of Waterloo, and cross-appointed to Sociology & Legal Studies, the School of Environment, Resources, & Sustainability (SERS), and Geography & Environmental Management (GEM). He primarily works in the areas of social network analysis and computational social science, with substantive interests in the sociology of science, environmental sociology, political sociology, and cognitive sociology.\nAbstract: TBA\nJulia Schulte-Cloos is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie funded research fellow at LMU Munich. She has earned her PhD in Political Science from the European University Institute. Julia is passionate about developing tools and templates for generating reproducible workflows and creating reproducible research outputs with R Markdown.\nAbstract: We present a template package in R that allows users without any prior knowledge of R Markdown to implement reproducible research practices in their scientific workflows. We provide a single Rmd-file that is fully optimized for two different output formats, HTML and PDF. While in the stage of explorative analysis and when focusing on content only, researchers may rely on the ‘draft mode’ of our template that knits to HTML When in the stage of research dissemination and when focusing on the presentation of results, in contrast, researchers may rely on the ‘manuscript mode’ that knits to PDF. Our template outlines the basics for successfully writing a reproducible paper in R Markdown by showing how to include citations, figures, and cross-references. It also provides examples for the use of ggplot2 to include plots, both in static and animated outputs, and it shows how to present the most commonly used tables in scientific research (descriptive statistics and regression tables). Finally, in our template, we discuss some more advanced features of literate programming and helpful tweaks in R Markdown.\nLauren Kennedy is a lecturer at Monash University (Melbourne, Australia), where she works creating survey weights and thinking about non-representative data, multilevel modelling, poststratification, causal inference, Bayesian inference and all manner of other related fields to making inference from the social sciences.\nAbstract: TBA\nMauricio Vargas Sepúlveda loves working with data and statistical programming, and is constantly learning new skills and tooling in his spare time. He mostly works in R due to its huge number of libraries and emphasis on reproducible analysis.\nAbstract: Evidence-based policymaking has turned into a high priority for governments across the world. The possibility of gaining efficiencies in the public expenditure and linking the policy design to the desired outcomes have been presented as significant advantages for the field of comparative policy. However, the same movement that supports the use of evidence in public policy decision making has brought a great concern about the sources of the supposed evidence. How should policymakers evaluate the evidence? The possibilities are open and depend on the institutional arrangements that support governmental operation and the possibility of properly judging the nature of the evidence. The movement of science reproducibility could enlighten the discussion about the quality of the evidence by providing a structured approach towards the source’s validity based on the possibility of reproducing the logic and analysis proper of scientific communication. This paper attempts to analyze the nature and quality of civil society organizations’ contributions to develop evidence for policymaking process from reproducibility perspective.\nMonica Alexander is an Assistant Professor in Statistical Sciences and Sociology at the University of Toronto. She received her PhD in Demography from the University of California, Berkeley. Her research interests include statistical demography, mortality and health inequalities, and computational social science.\nAbstract: TBA\nNancy Reid is Professor of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto and Canada Research Chair in Statistical Theory and Applications. Her main area of research is theoretical statistics. This treats the foundations and properties of methods of statistical inference. She is interested in how best to use information in the data to construct inferential statements about quantities of interest. A very simple example of this is the widely quoted ‘margin of error’ in the reporting of polls, another is the ubiquitous ‘p-value’ reported in medical and health studies. Much of her research considers how to ensure that these inferential statements are both accurate and effective at summarizing complex sets of data.\nAbstract: TBA\nNick Radcliffe runs a small data science company in Edinburgh, Scotland, and is acting Chief Data Scientist for the Global Open Finance Centre of Excellence, which is a non-profit being incubated at University of Edinburgh. He is also a Visiting Professor in Maths & Stats at University of Edinburgh.\nAbstract: TBA\nNicolas Didier is studying for a PhD in Public Administration and Policy at the Arizona State University. During his PhD studies and previous studies, he has worked extensively on developing evidence that addresses policy in labour markets and public expenditure.\nAbstract: Please see Mauricio Vargas Sepúlveda.\nRyan Briggs is a social scientist who studies the political economy of poverty alleviation. Most of his research focuses on the spatial targeting of foreign aid. He is an Assistant Professor in the Guelph Institute of Development Studies and Department of Political Science at the University of Guelph. Before that, he taught at Virginia Tech and American University.\nAbstract: TBA\nSharla Gelfand is a freelance R and Shiny developer specializing in enabling easy access to data and replacing manual, redundant processes with ones that are automated, reproducible, and repeatable. They also co-organize R-Ladies Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area R User Group. They like R (of course), dogs, learning Spanish, playing bass, and punk.\nAbstract: Getting stuck, looking around for a solution, and eventually asking for help is an inevitable and constant aspect of being a programmer. If you’ve ever looked up a question only to find some brave soul getting torn apart on Stack Overflow for not providing a minimum working example, you know it’s also one of the most intimidating parts! A minimum working example, or a reproducible example as it’s more often called in the R world, is one of the best ways to get help with your code - but what exactly is a reproducible example? How do you create one, and do it efficiently? Why is it so scary? This talk will cover what components are needed to make a good reproducible example to maximize your ability to get help (and to help yourself!), strategies for coming up with an example and testing its reproducibility, and why you should care about making one. We will also discuss how to extend the concept of reproducible examples beyond “Help! my code doesn’t work” to other environments where you might want to share code, like teaching and blogging.\nShemra Rizzo is a senior data scientist in Genentech’s Personalized Healthcare group. Shemra’s role includes research on COVID-19 using electronic health records, and the development of data-driven approaches to evaluate clinical trial eligibility criteria. Shemra obtained her PhD in Biostatistics from UCLA. Before joining Genentech, Shemra was an assistant professor of statistics at UC Riverside, where her research covered topics in mental health, health disparities, and nutrition. In her free time, Shemra enjoys spending time with her family and running.\nAbstract: Reproducibility when working with EHR licensed data.\nShiro Kuriwaki is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University. His research focuses on democratic representation in American Politics. In an ongoing project, he studies the structure of voter’s choices across levels of government and the political economy of local elections, using cast vote records and surveys. His other projects also help understand the mechanics of representation, including: public opinion and Congress, modern survey statistics and causal inference, and election administration. Prior to and during graduate school, he worked at the Analyst Institute in Washington D.C.\nAbstract: TBA\nSimeon Carstens is a Data Scientist at Tweag I/O, a software innovation lab and consulting company. Originally a physicist, Simeon did a PhD and postdoc research in computational biology, focusing on Bayesian determination of three-dimensional chromosome structures.\nAbstract: Data analysis often requires a complex software environment containing one or several programming languages, language-specific modules and external dependencies, all in compatible versions. This poses a challenge to reproducibility: what good is a well-designed, tested and documented data analysis pipeline if it is difficult to replicate the software environment required to run it? Standard tools such as Python / R virtual environments solve part of the problem, but do not take into account external and system-level dependencies. Nix is a fully declarative, open-source package manager solving this problem: a program packaged with Nix comes with a complete description of its full dependency tree, down to system libraries. In this presentation, I will give an introduction to Nix, show in a live demo how to set up a fully reproducible software environment and compare Nix to existing solutions such as virtual environments and Docker.\nTiffany Timbers is an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Statistics and an Co-Director for the Master of Data Science program (Vancouver Option) at the University of British Columbia. In these roles she teaches and develops curriculum around the responsible application of Data Science to solve real-world problems. One of her favourite courses she teaches is a graduate course on collaborative software development, which focuses on teaching how to create R and Python packages using modern tools and workflows.\nAbstract: TBA\nTom Barton is a PhD student in Politics at Royal Holloway, University of London. His PhD focuses on the impact of Voter Identification laws on political participation and attitudes. More generally his interests include elections, public opinion (particularly social values) and quantitative research methods.\nAbstract: I reproduce Surridge, 2016, ‘Education and liberalism: pursuing the link’, Oxford Review of Education, 42:2, pp. 146-164, using the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), instead using a difference-in-difference regression approach with more waves of data. I find that whilst there is evidence for both socialisation and self-selection models, self-selection dominates the link between social values and university attendance. This is counter to what Surridge (2016) concluded. The need for re-specification was two-fold, first Surridge’s methodology did not fully test for causality and secondly later waves have data have become available since.\nTyler Girard is a PhD Candidate in political science at the University of Western Ontario (London, Ontario, Canada). His dissertation research seeks to explain the origins and diffusion of the global financial inclusion agenda by focusing on the role of ambiguous ideas in mobilizing and consolidating transnational coalitions. More generally, his work also explores new approaches to conceptual measurement in international relations.\nAbstract: In what ways can we incorporate reproducible practices in pedagogy for social science courses? I discuss how individual and group exercises centered around the replication of existing datasets and analyses offer a flexible tool for experiential learning. However, maximizing the benefits of such an approach requires customizing the activity to the students and the availability of instructor support. I offer several suggestions for effectively using replication exercises in both undergraduate and graduate level courses.\nWijdan Tariq is an undergraduate student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.\nAbstract: I undertake a narrow replication of Caicedo, 2019, ‘The Mission: Human Capital Transmission, Economic Persistence, and Culture in South America’, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 134:1, pp. 507-556. Caicedo reports of a remarkable, religiously inspired human capital intervention that took place in remote parts of South America 250 years ago and whose positive economic effects, he claims, persist to this day. I replicate some of the paper’s key results using data files that are available on the Harvard Dataverse portal. I discuss some lessons learned in the process of replicating this paper and share some reflections on the state of reproducibility in economics.\nYanbo Tang is a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto in the Department of Statistical Sciences, under the joint supervision of Nancy Reid and Daniel Roy. He is interested in the study and application of methods in higher order asymptotics and statistical inference in the presence of many nuisance parameters. Nowadays, he works under the careful gaze of his pet parrot.\nAbstract: Hypothesis testing results often rely on simple, yet important assumptions about the behavior of the distribution of p-values under the null and alternative. We show that commonly held beliefs regarding the distribution of p-values are misleading when the variance or location of the test statistic are not well-calibrated or when the higher order cumulants of the test statistic are not negligible. We further examine the impact of having these misleading p-values on reproducibility of scientific studies, with some examples focused on GWAS studies.

There will be changes to this before this course is taught again.\nPreamble\nSyllabus\nTBA\nOverview\n\nThe best thing about being a statistician, is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.\nJohn Tukey\n\nThe work of applied statisticians, regardless of their specific job title and area of application, is the most important and exciting work in the world right now. The ability to gather data, analyse it, and communicate your understanding of the underlying process is incredibly valuable. In this course you will learn and apply the essentials of this.\nWe focus on surveys, sampling and observational data. The very stuff of statistical science! We will approach these topics from a practical perspective. You will actually run surveys and learn how messy it is to put one together. You will learn how to think about sampling, how to implement it, and why the details matter. You will forecast an election. And you will conduct original research. More generally, you will learn how to obtain and analyse data and use it to make sensible claims about the world.\nTo work as an applied statistician requires you to be able to, as part of a small team: - Gather data in less-than-perfect settings. - Efficiently prepare and clean data toward some purpose. - Analyse it in a reproducible, thorough, modern, and statistically-mature manner. - Communicate your analysis to stakeholders including colleagues and clients with and without formal statistical training.\nYou likely have some of these skills already. This course will further develop them. At the end of the course you will have a portfolio of work focused on surveying, sampling, and observational data, that you could show off to a potential employer.\nEach week you will read relevant papers and books, engage with them through discussion with each other, myself, and the TA. You will bring this all together and show off how much you have learnt through practical, on-going, assessment.\nIt is important to recognise that putting together everything that you have learnt to this point in this way will be difficult. It is not possible to cover everything that you will need to know. You should proactively identify and address aspects where you are weak through seeking additional information and resources. This course acts as a guide as to what is important, it does not contain everything that is important.\nThis course is different to many other courses at the University of Toronto. At the end of this course, you will have a portfolio of work that you could show off to a potential employer. You will have developed the skills to work successfully as an applied statistician or data scientist. And you will know how to fill gaps in your knowledge yourself. A lot of scholarships and jobs these days ask for GitHub and blog links etc to show off a portfolio of your work. This is the class that gives you a chance to develop these. It’s very important to having something to show that needs to go beyond what is done in a normal class.\nHow to succeed\nIn this course you will work in a self-directed, open-ended manner. Identify relevant areas of interest and then learn the skills that you need to explore those areas.\nTo successfully complete this course, you should expect to spend a large portion of your time reading and writing (both code and text). Deeply engage with the materials. Find a small study group and keep each other motivated and focused. At the start of the week, read the course notes, all compulsory materials and some recommended materials based on your interest. After doing that, but before the ‘lecture’ time you should complete the weekly quiz. During ‘lectures’ I’ll live-code, discuss materials in the course notes, talk about an experiment, and you’ll have a chance to discuss the materials with me.\nYou need to be more active in your learning in this course than others - read the notes and related materials - and then go out there and teach yourself more and apply it. You will not be spoon-fed in this course. Each week try to write reproducible, understandable, R code surrounded by beautifully crafted text that motivates, backgrounds, explains, discusses and criticizes. Make steady progress toward the assessment.\nThis is not a ‘bird course’. Typically, after the term is finished, students say that the course is difficult but rewarding. The TAs and I are always available to answer any questions. Please come to office hours!\nHow we’ll work\nThis webpage will provide almost all the guiding materials that you need and links to the relevant parts of the notes. The course notes are available here: https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com. Those contain notes and other material that you could go over. There is a course Slack for discussion. We’ll use Quercus really only for assessment submission and grading. I expect you to work professionally, and so we’ll try to use professional tools to the extent possible.\nA rough weekly flow for the course would be something like:\nRead the week’s course notes.\nRead/watch/listen to the compulsory materials.\nComplete the weekly quiz.\nAttend the lecture.\nAttend the lab.\nMake progress on a paper.\nAdvice from past students\nSuccessful past students have the following advice (completely unedited by me):\n“Start reading and writing on a weekly basis, watch some videos on R and RMD but more importantly learn how to use Google.”\n“It is not a wise idea to take this course if you did not take any other STA 300 level course before.”\n“Start early, find a group of people you trust enough to divide the work up fairly. Let people work to their strengths (people who know R should do the modelling, good writers should write most of the reports, etc.)”\n“Not to worry if you don’t do well on the first problem set—the nature of the course is to build up skills overtime, and it’s meant to be challenging in the beginning. In the end, it is worth it because you learn very valuable applicable skills on how to write professional reports.”\n“Work on your writing and direction following skills.”\n“Look at the rubric. There were times that I lost marks because I didn’t follow the rubric properly. Go to office hours, they are very useful as you can ask your own question and also get answers to questions other people ask and you didn’t think of. Also, do the assignments to the best of your ability. You will lose marks if you don’t put in effort and the only person you’re hurting is yourself.”\n“During lectures, focus more on the why the prof is doing what he’s doing. When he runs certain commands in R, figure out why that sequence of code gives what you want, because it’ll help adapt his code into your assignment code. just remembering what he’s doing in lecture becomes useless really quickly since the thought process matters more. also, start everything early.”\n“Do this course when you really want to learn something and have a lot of time to working on it.”\n“you need to be very skillful in RStudio and latex. Otherwise you would be struggling.”\n“Try to incorporate the feedback given and read a looottttttttt. Also start early on the problem sets because they tend to take a lot of time. Don’t give up!”\n“-Find a good group for problem sets”\n“If the assignments stay the same, I would tell students to approach this class from the perspective of ‘storytelling with statistics’ rather than a statistics course. You need to use R, and Markdown, and have a solid understanding of concepts like regression and sampling, but more importantly you need to be able to interpret results and write about them in a way coherent and professional way.”\n“do your readings”\n“Definitely get ready to write reports”\n“Do not take sta304 with Prof Rohan, it is pretty tough”\n“Start your work a bit earlier, make sure to follow the format expected and the rubric exactly.”\n“Read course material. Figure out WHY this paper/video is being shown to you and what you generally learn from it. Surround yourself with people dedicated to putting in the effort to understand material and who are thorough in their work so you can discuss content and/or work together.”\n“1. Be prepared to work extremely hard (8-11 hours a week). 2. Learn RStudio before course begins–STA130 is ideal preparation. 3. Start problem sets as soon as they are released.”\n“learn to code early and extensively use the office hours with the prof.”\n“This course requires lots of time dedicated and is not an”easy bird course\" but is an incredibly rewarding course if one wants to learn how statistics is applied in the real world.\"\nAcknowledgements\nThank you to the following people for generously providing comments, references, suggestions, and thoughts that directly contributed to this outline: Bethany White, Dan Simpson, Jesse Gronsbell, Kelly Lyons, Lauren Kennedy, and Monica Alexander. Thank you especially to Samantha-Jo Caetano who influenced all aspects of this and co-taught the first version in Fall 2020 .\nContent\nThe following is tentative and will update as we go through the term. Weeks 11 and 12 will be adjusted to make space for the content in earlier weeks to the extent necessary.\nEach week you should go through the course notes and all compulsory materials. During the lecture I will live-code various aspects. I will also discuss a case study, typically a paper. During the lab, a TA will either lead small group discussions or similarly lead other work. The lecture will be recorded and posted here, but again, it’s not enough to just watch that - you need to read and write yourself.\nWeek 1\nDate TBA, ‘Drinking from a fire hose’.\nLecture: Hello world!, R Essentials, Workflow, Graphs, tables and writing.\nCase Study: Fisher’s Lady Tasting Tea.\nLab: Go through DoSS Toolkit ‘White’, ‘Yellow’, and ‘Green’ and discuss any issues with the TA.\nWeek 2\nDate TBA, ‘Sampling and survey essentials’\nLecture: TBA.\nCase Study: TBA.\nLab: TBA.\nWeek 3\nDate TBA, ‘Stratified, systematic, and cluster sampling’\nLecture: TBA.\nCase Study: TBA.\nLab: TBA.\nWeek 4\nDate TBA, ‘IJALM’\nLecture: TBA.\nCase Study: TBA.\nLab: TBA.\nWeek 5\nDate TBA, ‘(Data) hunter-gatherer’.\nLecture: Scraping, surveys, open data, etc.\nCase Study: Student Coaching: How Far Can Technology Go?

Then look at Policing the Pandemic - https://www.policingthepandemic.ca/. Look into how they gathered their dataset and what it took to put this together. What is in the dataset and why? What is missing and why? How could this affect the results? How might similar biases enter into other datasets that you have used or read about? Put together a brief model. You may like to write a short blog post about the biases and influences that are in this dataset (if you do that please do email a link to me out of interest).\n\nWeek 12\nDate TBA, ‘Lorem ipsum’.\nLecture: Text-as-data.\nCase Study: Kevin Munger, Patrick Egan, Jonathan Nagler, Jonathan Ronen, and Joshua A.
