[Academic CV](pdfs/cv-academic-Rohan_Alexander.pdf)

My academic interests are multidisciplinary but fall at the intersection of information and statistical science. I use quantitative methods to explore human-centered questions with an emphasis on data concerns. I am interested in not only statistical science, that is, drawing quantitative inferences from real-world data, but also in information science, through my emphasis on all aspects of obtaining, preparing, storing, and sharing data.

My work is arranged around three tranches:

- Multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP).
- Natural language processing (NLP).
- Statistical workflow.
