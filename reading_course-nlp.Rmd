title: "Reading Course: 'Natural Language Processing'"
description: |
  This is a reading course available to students at the Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto.

# Overview

The purpose of this reading course is to develop students who can:

- engage in thoughtful, ethical, critique of natural language processing;
- work productively to implement existing NLP methods; and
- use NLP to contribute to our understanding of the world.

Each week you will read relevant papers and books, engaging with them by writing notes and completing exercises. You will use GitHub to manage these notes and exercises and email a link to me each week. This will account for 10 per cent of your mark. You will also give two presentations, each worth 20 per cent, over the course of the term. These will occur during the regular monthly lab presentations. Finally, you will write a research paper, due at the end of the term (the last day of the exam period or earlier if mutually agreed). This will be worth 50 per cent and will be marked by me and reviewed by another DoSS professor.
