## Preamble 

### Overview


To a certain extent we are wasting our time. We have a perfect model of the world--it is the world! But it is too complicated. Because of this we must simplify the world in order for it to become data. In this course we explore how we do this, and the implications.


### FAQ

- Can I audit this course? Sure, but it is pointless, because the only way to learn this stuff is to do the work.
- What is a tutorial? You write a paper. Then you send it to your tutor. The next day you have a meeting, 'tutorial', where you discuss it with them.
- Why is there so much assessment? The only way to learn is to actually do the work, and students only do the work when they are assessed. It is unfortunate, but there's no way around it.
