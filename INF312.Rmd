## Preamble 

### Overview


To a certain extent we are wasting our time. We have a perfect model of the world--it is the world! But it is too complicated. Because of this we must simplify the world in order for it to become data. In this course we explore how we do this, and the implications.


### FAQ

- Can I audit this course? Sure, but it is pointless, because the only way to learn this stuff is to do the work.
- What is a tutorial? You write a paper. Then you send it to your tutor. The next day you have a meeting, 'tutorial', where you discuss it with them.
- Why is there so much assessment? The only way to learn is to actually do the work, and students only do the work when they are assessed. It is unfortunate, but there's no way around it.

| ------------- | -------------:| -----:|

| Tutorial 						| 20 		 | Weekly the day before the tutorial |
| Paper 1 							| 25 		 | End of Week 3 |

You must submit Paper 1. And you must submit the Final Paper.

'End of' means Sunday 11:59pm.

Beyond that, you have scope to pick an assessment schedule that works for you. We will take your best 3 of the 11 tutorials, or your best 8 of 11 quizzes for that 20 per cent---whichever results in a better grade for you (i.e. you can choose to do either quizzes or tutorials). And we will take your two best papers from Papers 1-4 for that 50 per cent (25 per cent for each). The remainder is made up of 1 per cent for submitting a draft of the Final Paper, 4 per cent for peer reviewing other people's drafts of the Final Paper, and 25 per cent for the Final Paper.

Additional details: 

- Quiz questions are drawn from those in the Quiz section that follows each chapter of *Telling Stories with Data*. Almost all of them are multiple choice, and you should expect to know the mark within two days of submission.
- Tutorial questions are drawn from those in the Tutorial section that follows each chapter of *Telling Stories with Data*. The general expectation (although this differs from week to week) is about two pages of written content, which the tutor will read, discuss with you, and then provide a mark. You should expect to know the mark within three days of of the tutorial.
- In general papers require a considerable amount of work, and are due after the material has been covered in quizzes and tutorials (i.e. you would draw on knowledge tested in the quizzes, and potentially material could be re-used from the tutorial material). In general, they require original work to some extent. Papers are taken from the Papers appendix of *Telling Stories with Data* and students have access to the grading rubrics before submission.
