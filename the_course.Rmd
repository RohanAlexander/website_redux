- Task: Please complete a weekly quiz in Quercus.
- Questions: The questions that form the quiz are drawn from those in the course notes.


### Professional conduct

- Due date: Anytime during the teaching term.
- Weight: 1 per cent
- Task: We (optionally) use Slack to interact in this class. At some point during the teaching term, please use Slack to answer another student's question or otherwise similarly be generally helpful in a professional manner. When you do that, please share the comment into the 'Professional conduct' channel and @ me (hover on the message, click share message, type in the channel 'profession_conduct', add a message that @'s me, and click 'share'). You'll get the full mark just for one helpful interaction. (If you are opting out of using Slack - which is entirely fine - then instead, at some point in the term send me an email with a link that is relevant to the course materials and that I should add to the course notes. Please be clear that this is your 'professional conduct' submission by stating that in the subject line.)
