## Preamble


### Overview

Experimental design has a long and robust tradition within traditional applications such as agriculture, medicine, physics, and chemistry. It allows us to speak of causality with confidence. Typically, these are situations in which control groups can be established, randomization is appropriate, and ethical concerns can be assuaged. Unfortunately, such a set-up is rarely possible in the full extent of the modern applications where we want to understand causality.

```

This course covers the traditional approaches and statistical methods, but focuses on what to do when traditional experimental design methods cannot be implemented or are not appropriate (i.e. what feels like most of the time these days). We cover experiments in their modern guise especially the concerns that we might have when we can run them; but also methods that can provide some causal understanding even when we cannot conduct traditional experiments. Importantly, these approaches do not rely on 'big data' or fancy statistics, but instead on thoroughly interrogating the data that are available to get understanding through as simple means as possible.

This is a hands-on course in which you will conduct research projects using real-world data. This means that you will: obtain and clean relevant datasets; develop your own research questions; use the statistical techniques that you are introduced to in class to answer those questions; and finally communicate your results in a meaningful way. This course is designed around approaches that are used extensively in academia, government, and industry. Furthermore, it includes many aspects, such as data cleaning and preparation, that are critical, but rarely taught. 

This course is different to many other courses at the University of Toronto. At the end of this course, you will have a portfolio of work that you could show off to a potential employer. You will have developed the skills to work successfully as an applied statistician or data scientist. And you will know how to fill gaps in your knowledge yourself. A lot of scholarships and jobs these days ask for GitHub and blog links etc to show off a portfolio of your work. This is the class that gives you a chance to develop these. It's very important to having something to show that needs to go beyond what is done in a normal class.

The syllabus is available [here](pdfs/2021-01-11-INF2178-syllabus.pdf).




### How to succeed

In this course you will work in a self-directed, open-ended manner. Identify relevant areas of interest and then learn the skills that you need to explore those areas. 

To successfully complete this course, you should expect to spend a large portion of your time reading and writing (both code and text). Deeply engage with the materials. Find a small study group and keep each other motivated and focused. At the start of the week, read the course notes, all compulsory materials and some recommended materials based on your interest. After doing that, but before the 'lecture' time you should complete the weekly quiz. During 'lectures' I'll live-code, discuss materials in the course notes, talk about an experiment, and you'll have a chance to discuss the materials with me. 

You need to be more active in your learning in this course than others - read the notes and related materials - and then go out there and teach yourself more and apply it. You will not be spoon-fed in this course. Each week try to write reproducible, understandable, R code surrounded by beautifully crafted text that motivates, backgrounds, explains, discusses and criticizes. Make steady progress toward the assessment.

This is not a 'bird course'. Typically, after the term is finished, students say that the course is difficult but rewarding. The TAs and I are always available to answer any questions. Please come to office hours!


### How we'll work

This webpage will provide almost all the guiding materials that you need and links to the relevant parts of the notes. The course notes are available here: https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com. Those contain notes and other material that you could go over. There is a course Slack for discussion. We'll use Quercus really only for assessment submission and grading. I expect you to work professionally, and so we'll try to use professional tools to the extent possible. 

A rough weekly flow for the course would be something like:

1. Read the week's course notes.
2. Read/watch/listen to the compulsory materials.
3. Complete the weekly quiz.
4. Attend the lecture.
5. Attend the lab.
6. Make progress on a paper.



### Advice from past students

Successful past students have the following advice (completely unedited by me):

- 'Start reading and writing on a weekly basis, watch some videos on R and RMD but more importantly learn how to use Google.'
- 'Start early, find a group of people you trust enough to divide the work up fairly. Let people work to their strengths (people who know R should do the modelling, good writers should write most of the reports, etc.)'
- 'Not to worry if you don't do well on the first problem set—the nature of the course is to build up skills overtime, and it's meant to be challenging in the beginning. In the end, it is worth it because you learn very valuable applicable skills on how to write professional reports.'
- 'Work on your writing and direction following skills.'
- 'Look at the rubric. There were times that I lost marks because I didn't follow the rubric properly. Go to office hours, they are very useful as you can ask your own question and also get answers to questions other people ask and you didn't think of. Also, do the assignments to the best of your ability. You will lose marks if you don't put in effort and the only person you're hurting is yourself.'
- 'During lectures, focus more on the why the prof is doing what he's doing. When he runs certain commands in R, figure out why that sequence of code gives what you want, because it'll help adapt his code into your assignment code. just remembering what he's doing in lecture becomes useless really quickly since the thought process matters more. also, start everything early. '
- 'Do this course when you really want to learn something and have a lot of time to working on it.'
- 'you need to be very skillful in RStudio and latex. Otherwise you would be struggling.'
- 'Try to incorporate the feedback given and read a looottttttttt. Also start early on the problem sets because they tend to take a lot of time. Don't give up!'
- 'Find a good group for problem sets'
- 'If the assignments stay the same, I would tell students to approach this class from the perspective of 'storytelling with statistics' rather than a statistics course. You need to use R, and Markdown, and have a solid understanding of concepts like regression and sampling, but more importantly you need to be able to interpret results and write about them in a way coherent and professional way.'
- 'do your readings'
- 'Definitely get ready to write reports'
- 'Echoing the people who said to read the rubrics and treat INF2178 as a storytelling with data course rather than INF1344 part 2. Let the point distribution rubric guide what parts of the paper to focus on/expand. And pay attention to the "telling stories" part of the site URL. The point of the papers isn't to chuck every statistical method and cool R trick you know in there, it's to practice building data-driven arguments that different audiences might actually care about. Last, the piece of advice I wish I had followed for the class: keep a log of things that you find confusing/cool/useful.'

## Content

**The following is tentative and will update as we go through the term. Weeks 11 and 12 will be adjusted to make space for the content in earlier weeks to the extent necessary.**

Each week you should go through the course notes and all compulsory materials. During the lecture I will live-code various aspects. I will also discuss a case study, typically a paper. During the lab, a TA will either lead small group discussions or similarly lead other work. The lecture will be recorded and posted here, but again, it's not enough to just watch that - you need to read and write yourself.

  - Please pretend that you work as a junior analyst for a large consulting firm. Further, pretend that your consulting firm has taken a contract to put together a facial recognition model for the Canada Border Services Agency's Inland Enforcement branch. Write five or six points with regard to your thoughts on this matter. What would you do and why? Then split into small groups and compare your points with others. Do you think the model would end up being implemented?
  - With the help of the TA, please conduct 'face-to-face' surveys (via Zoom). For this exercise, you will be randomly split into groups of two. You have two minutes in each group and will then be swapped to another group. One person is to survey the other person asking the following questions: i) 'What is your gender?', ii) 'What is your age?', iii) 'What is your marital status?', iv) 'What is your income?', v) 'If an election were held today who would you vote for?'. After one person is done, then switch roles. When you are the questioner you should record all responses using a small CSV (but not the person's name please). When you are the respondent you are welcome to not respond. You will cycle through this multiple times. At the end, please write a small reflection about: 1) as a respondent, how you felt answering these questions and the implications that you think this feeling may have for how survey questions are answered more generally; and 2) as a questioner, how difficult it was to code responses and the implications this may have for the dataset that we analyse.
